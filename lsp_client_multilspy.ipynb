      "//!\n",
      "//! The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a\n",
      "//! set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the [broader Rust\n",
      "//! ecosystem][crates.io]. It offers core types, like [`Vec<T>`] and\n",
      "//! [`Option<T>`], library-defined [operations on language\n",
      "//! primitives](#primitives), [standard macros](#macros), [I/O] and\n",
      "//! [multithreading], among [many other things][other].\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! `std` is available to all Rust crates by default. Therefore, the\n",
      "//! standard library can be accessed in [`use`] statements through the path\n",
      "//! `std`, as in [`use std::env`].\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! # How to read this documentation\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! If you already know the name of what you are looking for, the fastest way to\n",
      "//! find it is to use the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.searchState.focus();\">search\n",
      "//! bar</a> at the top of the page.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Otherwise, you may want to jump to one of these useful sections:\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! * [`std::*` modules](#modules)\n",
      "//! * [Primitive types](#primitives)\n",
      "//! * [Standard macros](#macros)\n",
      "//! * [The Rust Prelude]\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! If this is your first time, the documentation for the standard library is\n",
      "//! written to be casually perused. Clicking on interesting things should\n",
      "//! generally lead you to interesting places. Still, there are important bits\n",
      "//! you don't want to miss, so read on for a tour of the standard library and\n",
      "//! its documentation!\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Once you are familiar with the contents of the standard library you may\n",
      "//! begin to find the verbosity of the prose distracting. At this stage in your\n",
      "//! development you may want to press the `[-]` button near the top of the\n",
      "//! page to collapse it into a more skimmable view.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! While you are looking at that `[-]` button also notice the `source`\n",
      "//! link. Rust's API documentation comes with the source code and you are\n",
      "//! encouraged to read it. The standard library source is generally high\n",
      "//! quality and a peek behind the curtains is often enlightening.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! # What is in the standard library documentation?\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! First of all, The Rust Standard Library is divided into a number of focused\n",
      "//! modules, [all listed further down this page](#modules). These modules are\n",
      "//! the bedrock upon which all of Rust is forged, and they have mighty names\n",
      "//! like [`std::slice`] and [`std::cmp`]. Modules' documentation typically\n",
      "//! includes an overview of the module along with examples, and are a smart\n",
      "//! place to start familiarizing yourself with the library.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Second, implicit methods on [primitive types] are documented here. This can\n",
      "//! be a source of confusion for two reasons:\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! 1. While primitives are implemented by the compiler, the standard library\n",
      "//!    implements methods directly on the primitive types (and it is the only\n",
      "//!    library that does so), which are [documented in the section on\n",
      "//!    primitives](#primitives).\n",
      "//! 2. The standard library exports many modules *with the same name as\n",
      "//!    primitive types*. These define additional items related to the primitive\n",
      "//!    type, but not the all-important methods.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! So for example there is a [page for the primitive type\n",
      "//! `i32`](primitive::i32) that lists all the methods that can be called on\n",
      "//! 32-bit integers (very useful), and there is a [page for the module\n",
      "//! `std::i32`] that documents the constant values [`MIN`] and [`MAX`] (rarely\n",
      "//! useful).\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Note the documentation for the primitives [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] (also\n",
      "//! called 'slice'). Many method calls on [`String`] and [`Vec<T>`] are actually\n",
      "//! calls to methods on [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] respectively, via [deref\n",
      "//! coercions][deref-coercions].\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Third, the standard library defines [The Rust Prelude], a small collection\n",
      "//! of items - mostly traits - that are imported into every module of every\n",
      "//! crate. The traits in the prelude are pervasive, making the prelude\n",
      "//! documentation a good entry point to learning about the library.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! And finally, the standard library exports a number of standard macros, and\n",
      "//! [lists them on this page](#macros) (technically, not all of the standard\n",
      "//! macros are defined by the standard library - some are defined by the\n",
      "//! compiler - but they are documented here the same). Like the prelude, the\n",
      "//! standard macros are imported by default into all crates.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! # Contributing changes to the documentation\n",

      "//!\n",
      "//! ## Containers and collections\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! The [`option`] and [`result`] modules define optional and error-handling\n",
      "//! types, [`Option<T>`] and [`Result<T, E>`]. The [`iter`] module defines\n",
      "//! Rust's iterator trait, [`Iterator`], which works with the [`for`] loop to\n",
      "//! access collections.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! The standard library exposes three common ways to deal with contiguous\n",
      "//! regions of memory:\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! * [`Vec<T>`] - A heap-allocated *vector* that is resizable at runtime.\n",
      "//! * [`[T; N]`][prim@array] - An inline *array* with a fixed size at compile time.\n",
      "//! * [`[T]`][prim@slice] - A dynamically sized *slice* into any other kind of contiguous\n",
      "//!   storage, whether heap-allocated or not.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Slices can only be handled through some kind of *pointer*, and as such come\n",
      "//! in many flavors such as:\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! * `&[T]` - *shared slice*\n",
      "//! * `&mut [T]` - *mutable slice*\n",
      "//! * [`Box<[T]>`][owned slice] - *owned slice*\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! [`str`], a UTF-8 string slice, is a primitive type, and the standard library\n",
      "//! defines many methods for it. Rust [`str`]s are typically accessed as\n",
      "//! immutable references: `&str`. Use the owned [`String`] for building and\n",
      "//! mutating strings.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! For converting to strings use the [`format!`] macro, and for converting from\n",
      "//! strings use the [`FromStr`] trait.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Data may be shared by placing it in a reference-counted box or the [`Rc`]\n",
      "//! type, and if further contained in a [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`], may be mutated\n",
      "//! as well as shared. Likewise, in a concurrent setting it is common to pair an\n",
      "//! atomically-reference-counted box, [`Arc`], with a [`Mutex`] to get the same\n",
      "//! effect.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! The [`collections`] module defines maps, sets, linked lists and other\n",
      "//! typical collection types, including the common [`HashMap<K, V>`].\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! ## Platform abstractions and I/O\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Besides basic data types, the standard library is largely concerned with\n",
      "//! abstracting over differences in common platforms, most notably Windows and\n",
      "//! Unix derivatives.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Common types of I/O, including [files], [TCP], and [UDP], are defined in\n",
      "//! the [`io`], [`fs`], and [`net`] modules.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! The [`thread`] module contains Rust's threading abstractions. [`sync`]\n",
      "//! contains further primitive shared memory types, including [`atomic`] and\n",
      "//! [`mpsc`], which contains the channel types for message passing.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! # Use before and after `main()`\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Many parts of the standard library are expected to work before and after `main()`;\n",
      "//! but this is not guaranteed or ensured by tests. It is recommended that you write your own tests\n",
      "//! and run them on each platform you wish to support.\n",
      "//! This means that use of `std` before/after main, especially of features that interact with the\n",
      "//! OS or global state, is exempted from stability and portability guarantees and instead only\n",
      "//! provided on a best-effort basis. Nevertheless bug reports are appreciated.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! On the other hand `core` and `alloc` are most likely to work in such environments with\n",
      "//! the caveat that any hookable behavior such as panics, oom handling or allocators will also\n",
      "//! depend on the compatibility of the hooks.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Some features may also behave differently outside main, e.g. stdio could become unbuffered,\n",
      "//! some panics might turn into aborts, backtraces might not get symbolicated or similar.\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! Non-exhaustive list of known limitations:\n",
      "//!\n",
      "//! - after-main use of thread-locals, which also affects additional features:\n",
      "//!   - [`thread::current()`]\n",
      "//!   - [`thread::scope()`]\n",
      "//!   - [`sync::mpsc`]\n",
